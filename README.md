# Hallucination Detection and Mitigation in Large Language Models (LLMs)
## Overview

This project focuses on addressing the issue of hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) — instances where the model generates content that is inaccurate, inconsistent, or not grounded in factual data. Such hallucinations can pose serious risks in critical domains like healthcare, law, finance, and education, where misinformation can have real-world consequences.

The proposed framework combines two complementary techniques — Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and factual consistency of LLM outputs.

## Approach

### Phase 1 – NLI-Based Detection:
Uses a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model (e.g., RoBERTa-MNLI) to identify intrinsic hallucinations by checking if an LLM’s response logically follows from the input prompt.

### Phase 2 – RAG-Based Mitigation:
Implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to minimize extrinsic hallucinations by grounding responses in verified external data sources. Initially tested in the sports domain, this phase ensures factual correctness through contextual retrieval and validation.

## Objectives

Detect and quantify intrinsic hallucinations using NLI.

Implement RAG-based systems for factual consistency.

Improve the trustworthiness and interpretability of LLM responses.

Build a scalable, domain-agnostic framework for hallucination detection and prevention.

## Technology Stack

Programming: Python

Models & Frameworks: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch/TensorFlow

Retrieval Tools: FAISS, ElasticSearch, LangChain, Haystack

Evaluation Metrics: Hallucination Score, Factual Consistency, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Impact

By integrating NLI-based detection and RAG-based mitigation, this project lays the foundation for trustworthy AI systems capable of providing accurate, verifiable, and contextually sound responses — a crucial step toward responsible deployment of LLMs in sensitive real-world applications.
